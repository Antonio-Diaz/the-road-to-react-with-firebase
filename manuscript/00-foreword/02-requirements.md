## Requirements

The requirements for this tutorial are a working [editor or IDE, a running command line](https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/), and installed recent versions of [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). In addition, you should have learned about React in the first place. [The Road to learn React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/) is a free ebook which gives you all the fundamentals of React. You will build a larger application along the way in plain React and transition smoothly from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6 and beyond. This tutorial will not dive into all the details taught in the ebook, so take the chance to grab your copy of it to learn about those first. In addition, please follow the referenced articles in this tutorial to understand many of the underlying implementation details in case things are not explained in depth. Two of them are important to understand, but they will be linked in the appropriate sections later on.
